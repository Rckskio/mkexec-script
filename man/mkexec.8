.SH NAME
mkexec \- Make Executable
.SH SYNOPSIS
mkexec [FILE] or mkexec [OPTION]... [FILE]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Mkexec is a bash script to help place your own scripts or binary files to /home/user/.local/bin. The PATH to place the file can be edited to your own preference. It's possible to use this script to place itself to the path /home/user/.local/bin or other specified using -p flag. The main goal is to help make it easier to run user scripts, by placing it on a directory that is usually already on user $PATH. Type echo $PATH to see all the directories already on it.
